## Description

Weather Dashboard exists to help users obtain information regarding the weather in cities they select. It was created by me as a way to further my developer experience. It taught me how to interact with third party api's to obtain the information I want. To use Weather Dashboard simply load the page, enter a USA city in the search box and click submit. It's that easy!
